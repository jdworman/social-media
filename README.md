# README

I created a social media platform called "Barefoot Backpackers."  I gave it that name because, it's all about having a backpacker live off a shoestring budget.   
I created five users who post 20 messages each.  In my social media you can log in and log out.  You can delete your account if you do not want to use it anymore.  I have a page that list the currently logged in user, see the users last 20 posts and to see other users last 20 post.  

I have my website on heroku at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/social-media-tumblr/activity/builds/2d74ddda-9164-4d48-8a00-42ac0d083729
